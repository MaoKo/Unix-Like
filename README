# Unix-Like OS

An educational Unix-Like operating system, inspired by the early Unix implementations. This project aims to mimic the foundational features of Unix, focusing on user accounts, memory pagination, and essential OS functionalities, all built from scratch in assembly.

## Features

- Minimalist Unix-like environment
- User account management
- Memory pagination
- Built with FASM (Flat Assembler) and GRUB 2.06

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To build and run this OS, you will need:
- **Flat Assembler (FASM)** for assembly language compilation
- **GRUB 2.06** for bootloading

### Building GRUB

To configure and build GRUB 2.06 for this project, follow these steps:

```bash
./configure --target=x86_64 --disable-werror
make
